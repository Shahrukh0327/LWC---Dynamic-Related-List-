Designed a custom Dynamic Related List component for object page layouts where Salesforce's native Dynamic Related List functionality is not supported. In my case, the Visit object page layout did not support it, so we developed an LWC that displays various related lists with record-filtering capabilities.


To set up this LWC:

First, create a custom tab that opens the 'View All' records in a sub-tab.
After that, add the LWC to the page layout and complete the necessary fields.
